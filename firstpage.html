                <p>In this page, we will be exploring the basic information of networking. Networking is all about connecting people together, examples of networking can include wifi connections, server connections and communications between networks.  </p>

                <p>Networking is a very broad subject but we'll just go through the basics. So to start off with, the definition connect as or operate with a network. As you can see here, you need many things to work as a network. There are many types of networks such as home, corperate, school, and also government networks. All these netoworks all serve difference purposes. For example a home network is used for providing internet service, wifi, and also file sharing on some devices if you have a sharing device. A corperate solution is used for sharing information between people, providing documents, and linking company programs too. On a school network is similar to what we use at school, it provides security, sharing documents and their own advertisements when we log in. In todays world we are always connected to a network, whether it's our phones or laptops to talk to people or even our opal cards connected to a network ran by the government to work out wa price for the bus or train trip. In a home network, it starts off with a copper port, going into your modem, a modem provides internet from the provider such as Optus or Telstra, that goes into a router or goes into a switch, which provides ethernet ports. This could also lead to a NAS which is a server connected wired or wireless, which can share files only to people connected to the internet network. </p>

                <p> With the help of many creators, we have come together to create this webstie to help out everyone and anyone. So from a message from all the creators and developers, we all hope you have fun and hope you learn some new information from here. Thanks - Michael - Creator of Michael's Tech Tips</p>
